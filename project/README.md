# Mars Rover Dashboard

This project is part of the requirements for the Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree Program, by Udacity.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide practice with:

- Functional concepts.
- Pure functions and iterations.
- Information being accessed from complex API responses.
- The ImmutableJS library.

## About the Mars Rover Dashboard

- The Mars Rover Dashboard consumes data from the NASA API.
- The user can select which rover's information they want to view by using a selection tab.
- Once a rover is selected, the user will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission: name, status, launch date, landing date, images taken date.
- There is a slider gallery with the most recent images sent from each mars rover.
- The dashboard is responsive on phones and desktop.

## Getting Started

- Create an API key through NASAâ€™s API.

- Create a `.env` file under `project` folder

- Place the Api Key in the `.env` file (`API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`)

- Install the dependecies: `yarn install`

- Run `yarn start`

- Open `http:localhost:3000`
